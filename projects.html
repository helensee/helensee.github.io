        About: The web app pulls the users wishlist and has a place for the user to sort through it based on title, sale
        price, and/or tag. First page lists the top 50 and has a bar graph of the games original price and sale price. Last page 
        is a small recommendation page. It gives a few recommended games based on the top 3 tags of the user. <br />
        I focused on working with the data.

    <p>
        Goal: Provide an application that allows food related groups, supermarkets or restaurants, to make event times for people
        that are part of SNAP. The application would also allow Non-profit organization volunteers to help during the distribution of
        food during the event.
    </p>
    <p>How it's made: The key pieces that builds this application is MySQL, Amazon Web Services, Node.js, Express.js, and Bootstrap</p>
    <p>My build: I focused on back-end since my main skill set is databases and manipulating the data. I designed the application and
    decided on the main functionalities.</p>
